                <strong>Privacy and Anonymity:</strong> You have the option to
                submit reports anonymously. However, anonymous reports may limit
                your ability to edit or delete the report after submission. We
                reserve the right to share anonymous reports with law
                enforcement agencies if required.<br />
                <strong>Verification:</strong> The App includes a community
                verification system where users can like or dislike reports
                denoting the authenticity of the reporting incident. Reports
